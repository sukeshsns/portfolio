    "description": "After nearly a year of working in Norway with Zabai AS through the Norec exchange program, I attended Norec’s mandatory one-week Homecoming Training in Kathmandu, following a digital pre-training. The course focused on recognizing and reflecting on the results achieved and competences acquired during the exchange, and on how to communicate and apply these experiences back home. Through modules on communicating the exchange, identifying new learning, navigating the challenges and opportunities of returning, and thematic workshops, I developed a clearer plan for sharing my insights and contributing to my home organization.",
